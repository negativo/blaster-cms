# Node CMS
(NoNameYet)

##OpenSource NodeJS CMS Framework.
###Simple node powered CMS for blog, small website and who knows.
Simple and light CMS framework build with NodeJS.

####Why
I'm building this to have a framework to start with when doing small blog and websites, I'm looking forward to switch from LAMP and wordpress to Node/Mean stacks forever, because I like this kind of stacks a lot more.

Templating is going to be easy, if you work on node adding custom logics too.
That's what I need to bootstrap my works.

###Ongoing
All basic function are working, it's time to give backend some UX/UI and start adding utility to backend, I'm thinking of a plugin system to add functionality with node modules, I'll start it when I'm done with everything else

##Installation

	npm install
	bower install
	npm start <<

npm start use nodemon on server.js if you have problem with it you should install it globally
	npm install -g nodemon

##Contributions
	CLOSED (just for a couple of week)
I'm refacotring a lot of thing now so it's difficult to contribute, I'll update this when I found a stable configuration.
Anyway every pull-request should be done on Test Branch.
