# Node CMS
(NoNameYet)

##OpenSource NodeJS CMS Framework.
###Simple node powered CMS for blog, small website and who knows.
Simple and light CMS framework build with NodeJS.

####Why
I'm building this to have a framework to start with when doing small blog and websites, I'm looking forward to switch from LAMP and wordpress to Node/Mean stacks forever, because I like this kind of stacks a lot more.

Templating is going to be easy, if you work on node adding custom logis too.
That's what I need to bootstrap my works.

###Ongoing
All the basics need are up, need to be refined.
