# Node CMS
(NoNameYet)

##OpenSource NodeJS CMS Framework.
###Simple node powered CMS for blog, small website and who knows.
Simple and light CMS framework build with NodeJS.

####Why
I'm building this to have a framework to start with when doing small blog and websites, I'm looking forward to switch from LAMP and wordpress to Node/Mean stacks forever, because I like this kind of stacks a lot more.

Templating is going to be easy, if you work on node adding custom logis too.
That's what I need to bootstrap my works.

###Ongoing
All the basic functions are working right now, need some stiling and a lot of page print data in JSON because I was too lazy.
I need to set all the json data in their place.


##changelog
	- Refactored Installation (yep another time*3)
		-- simplified installation
	- refactored isInstalled middleare
		--simplified and less stressfull
	- Templating redefined
		-- added some .less
	-- dashboard working need some css love

##ToDos
	- Style everything that's missing
	- Configuration and User panel in dashboard
	- Methods for configurations changes
	- theme change methods
	- adding a method that will prepend to header.ejs all the needed variables and methods 
	  so when templating you wont need to do it youself.
